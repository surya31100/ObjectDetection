# maskdetection
object detection project on mask detection dataset. The dataset has images and annotations divided into 3 classes.
In the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, it is crucial to implement effective measures to control the spread of the virus. One such measure is the use of facial masks. To achieve this, we propose the development of a mask detection algorithm capable of identifying individuals wearing facial masks, those without masks, and those wearing masks incorrectly.
The project focuses on studying a diverse dataset containing images of people in different scenarios with respect to mask-wearing. The dataset includes three classes: "With mask," "Without mask," and "Mask worn incorrectly." 
We aim to explore various deep learning solutions, including the DenseNet architecture, ResNet with residual blocks, and potentially other models. Each model will undergo thorough training and evaluation to determine its accuracy and performance on the mask detection task. Furthermore, we will compare the results achieved by different models to identify the most effective algorithm.
The dataset we have used for this project is Face Mask Detection.
About the dataset: Masks are essential for safeguarding individuals from respiratory diseases, especially when there is no vaccination available for COVID-19. This dataset consists of 853 images. The dataset also includes information about the bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format, which can be used to develop a model for detecting these different mask-wearing behaviors.
We have divided the 853 images into three categories. They are:
•	People with mask.
•	People without mask.
•	People who wear mask incorrectly.
